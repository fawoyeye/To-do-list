This to-do list app is me trying out a lot of things. Trying out my problem solving skills. I used the math object, the date object to print out the day of the week and the current time. I also wanted to use an svg because I thought svgs are always used for apps.
I thought I wanted to use an Api for the motivational quotes but I used arrays. I hope to add more motivational quotes to the arrays in the future. 
I was also trying out making the to do list user friendly by displaying the users name.
I used set timeout to make the alert in the second page pop up 5 minutes after page loads.


improvement
I want to insert a cookie so it does not have to display a prompt everytime the page loads
Maybe put it all in a page. I feel like it does not need to be in two pages but I was trying out sonething like an app
